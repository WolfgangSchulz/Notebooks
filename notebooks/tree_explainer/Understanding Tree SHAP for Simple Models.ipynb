    "# Understanding Tree SHAP for Simple Models\n",

    "The SHAP value for a feature is the average change in model output by conditioning on that feature when introducing features one at a time over all feature orderings. While this is easy to state, it is challenging to compute. So this notebook is meant to give a few simple examples where we can see how this plays out for very small trees. For arbitrary large trees it is very hard to intuitively guess these values by looking at the tree."
